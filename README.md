Serial-Handshaking
==================

This example demonstrates the hardware handshaking mode (i.e. RTS/CTS) provided by the USART peripherals on AT91 microcontrollers. The practical  use of hardware handshaking is that it allows to stop transfer on the USART  without losing any data in the process. This is very useful for applications  that need to program slow memories for example.
